# Introduction to the Bags of Words, or, Don't Fear Word Clouds

Wordclouds demonstrate the basic function of textual analysis quite succinctly. Every tool we'll look at today includes some type of word cloud. There are also many tools online that will produce words. 

[Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/) helped to make Word Clouds prominent but the technology it used to create the word clouds is no longer supported by most browsers. 

One online word cloud creator we often use is [TagCrowd.com](https://tagcrowd.com/). You can see these clouds in many of our digital collections to provide an overview of the collection and a browsing mechanism.
